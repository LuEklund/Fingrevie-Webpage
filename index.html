                What are we working on this summer?</br></br>
                We have been following a few games that are based on the tower defense and rogue-like genres and arrived at the conclusion that the market is unsatisfied with options (including us). We are currently working on our first game title, a PvE Rogue-like Tower Defense with a semi-randomly generating map that includes a hero that you can level, gear, and control in the map. We envision a game where each run is unique, as the map is different each time, and you get to choose rogue-like elements and upgrades...</br></br></br>
